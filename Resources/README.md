Overview of Project

We were tasked with creating a workbook to analyze the performance of a limited number of stocks from 2017 and 2018. 
The project expanded to allow for large data sets by running the code more quickly and efficiently through refactoring the code.

Results

The code was refactored to run more efficiently by using an index rather than IF statments. 
This created less work to process the code by being simpler and as a result the time needed to analyze a large set of stocks would be reduced.


Summary

The clear advantage of refactoring code is that it will run more efficiently, thereby faster, and the volume of data can be increased with
less processing time than would otherwise be needed.

The disadvantages would include the time needed to refactor the code, as well the skill needed. If code is already running without errors,
we also risk having code that doesn't work. With our current use, as a percentage of change, the increase of speed is sizable.
Although in terms of run time, in either version it finishes so quickly, the user likely wouldn't notice.
